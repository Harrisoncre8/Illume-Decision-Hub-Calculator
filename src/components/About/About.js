            <ul className="">
              <li>
                To help small to midsize business owners understand how changes 
                in their financial decision-making could affect their future profitability.
              </li> 
              <li>
                Currently, Jenny and Susan see many of their clients suffer through barriers to 
                making these informed decisions. Their clients are limited by convoluted financial 
                jargon, feeling overworked and underpaid, and having a lack of clear information.
              </li>
              <li>
                They see women business owners paying themselves less than men who own businesses, 
                clients burning themselves out with a lack of work life balance, and an overall lack 
                of confidence in making financial change. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Jenny and Susan took on the challenge of simplifying the process by formulating 
                a dynamic tool to help clients make these educated business decisions, so that both 
                they and their clients could work less and earn more.

                The Illume Decision Hub addresses the challenge of handling unreadable spreadsheets by dynamically 
                collecting data that the user types in and uses it throughout their financial 
                calculation process.
              </li> 
              <li>
                Using conversational language in tandem with help text, the application 
                is able to translate financial jargon into easy to understand language.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Illume Decision Hub also identifies for clients many unknown financial factors 
                such as indirect costs and increasing prices as a way to improve profits. 
              </li>
              <li>
                On the results page, the application uses Predictive Calculations to translate 
                the userâ€™s outputs into easy to understand call to actions. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Along with solving the listed challenges, the Illume Decision Hub helps users 
                generate new Profit Opportunities that they can further explore.  
              </li>
            </ul>

            <div className="slide-name n3">
              The Illume Decision Hub started as an idea to help people work less and earn more and we 
              hope it will become a tool that encourages you to understand the worth of your 
              time, effort, and product.
